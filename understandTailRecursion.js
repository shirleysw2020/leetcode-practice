//Tail Recursion
// Calculate as we go by using an accumulator argument. This is more efficient than traditional recursion which has to call itself until it cannot then start calculating backwards.

// Make a single recursion call, and the last thing you do is make that recursive call. And thatâ€™s the last thing you ever do

// Fibonnachi example:
/*
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 ...... Infinity

Original:
fib 0 = 0
fib 1 = 1
fib n = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

WHY inefficient:
- uses double recursion - 2 recursion call
- recomputing same fibonnachi numbers all the time
