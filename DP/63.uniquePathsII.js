/**
 * Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right

 * @param {number[][]} obstacleGrid

/*
Time Complexity: O(M x N)O(MÃ—N). The rectangular grid given to us is of size M x N and we process each cell just once.
Space Complexity: O(1). We are utilizing the obstacleGrid as the DP array. Hence, no extra space.
